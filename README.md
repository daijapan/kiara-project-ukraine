We have a passion to protect our peace, freedom and security.
Japan is known as the most peaceful place in the world.
Also, we are known as the country of hospitality.
In our area JR Chuo-line, we have awesome culture like comic and animation.

Our gaol is to support Ukrainian people as many as possible.
We use IT tools, lots of automation and AI/Blockchain.
Since many NPOs have human resource / funding problem,
we focus on "the scalable, easy, economical, sustainable, secure" solution for such social project.
